#TextMyIP

The concept is that you can send a text from your email account. 

You need to look up the server info for your email host.
You also need to know the cell phone carrier and look up their url for receiving text from emails.

Then make your IoT device run the script at startup to look up its ip and use cURL to email it to your phone.
